			<p>welcome to <b>my personal site</b>! let me take you on a little journey...</p>
			
			<p>after completing my degree in english, i felt very aimless. i have lots of interests but i never felt extremely skilled at one thing in particular. ive always gone from one interest to the next, delving in deep and then a month later turning the page onto another as if the previous hadn't even existed.</p>
			
			<p>when i finally started working, i was given the opportunity to help out the marketing team through graphic design. this instantly sparked my interest and i've been on a wonderful journey of teaching myself new techniques daily to imporve my skills and improve my work while supporting my coworkers.</p>
			
			<p>i always had an interest in graphic design and, of course, took some classes in college with the original intent to complete a certificate of graphic design alongside my english major. to go even further back in time, in my middle and high school i was an avid user of tumblr. anyone who used it knows where this is going. i <b>loved</b> customizing my tumblr blog. this is what originally sparked my interest in html and css. i spent most of my time altering premade templates, and learning a little about how to code on my own.</p>
				
			<p>but around the time i graduated highschool, i had moved on and wasn't really interested in web design because i was becoming an avid reader. time went on and then i saw 'web design' being offered through my school's online degree program. i was so excited and took the first class and fell in love all over again. </p>
			
			<p>i made a personal website for logging my movies and tv shows, called 'the shelf.' sounds familiar, right? well you can find the project page for that <a href="project.html?id=type-specimen">.ᐟ <b>here</b></a>. i worked on this website in all my free time and then continued onto the advanced web design class, learning how to use javascript to add customization and fun to my project.</p>
			
			<p>to make a long winded story short, i have always had a passion for graphic design, and more specifically, web design. this was a passion project at first, but soon after i realized the importance of having a small corner of the internet to call <b>my own</b>. this also serves as a digital portfolio and a testament to my hard work and efforts, as well as my growth as a professional individual.</p>
			
			<p>living and existing in the "real world" is hard, and it's important that we have these small delights which can bring us some peace at the end of the day.</p>

			<h2 class="about-subtitle">anti-ai ramble</h2>
            <p>in the "ai era" it is so important to make things yourself. flex those brain muscles and write the code yourself, find resources, surf the web for inspiration, and most importantly <b>teach yourself</b>. it's so easy to just ask an ai to do things for you, but did you actually retain any of the information it's giving you? do you remember what all those classes mean how it functions? do you understand why it works that way?</p>
			
			<p>sure when you do it yourself the code might not function properly and it's hard and it takes sooo long, but who cares? if you pour your passion into a project, small errors shouldn't matter and, even better, you get to do the research yourself and figure out <b>why</b> it didn't work and how to fix it and prevent it from happening later.</p>
