**too cringe to reread or fix, creative fiction but obviously about my own experiences :/**

Somehow we have ended back here again, you and I. I’ve worn the same clothes for two days now, wondering if I smell bad in the passenger seat of your Toyota Corolla, 2011, dark gray, I could recognize it anywhere from the deep dent in the back bumper on the left side. We never found out who hit you, but I still wonder, even now. I tuck my shoes under my legs and sit cross legged, heart already burning. When you start talking, I can feel the lump growing in my throat, making it hard to breathe. We make our way down my street and take a left, like we always do.   

We’ve gotten into another argument, something small, miniscule and stupid. I wish now that I had kept my mouth shut. It’s always like that, I get angry and lash out, and then the first starts up again and here we end. As you drive and talk, explaining your side as if I haven’t heard it a million times before, I look out the window and wonder if this is going to be the last time. Maybe this will be the last time we do this dance, arguing our way into a break up, not seeing eye to eye on how we’re hurting each other.  

Sometimes, I think that my life is simply made up of important moments, and all the insignificant things between these events, like this one, are just filler pages in this book. Like my shifts at work, Zoom meetings and emails, text messages to people I no longer call friends.   

The main road to and from the town is lonely and dark as we make our journey down the unlit street. I’ve driven this road so many times I could do it with my eyes closed. We pass the deep curve around the brooke halfway to the high school. Then come past the house covered in political flags and signs. I try to read them all without enough time. Then the standalone wood cabin with its flame covered mailbox that sticks out from all the gray, yellow, and blue suburban homes that overlook the street with their white picket fences and pristine yards, saying *I’m better than you*. I wonder what each family is doing inside. Likely sleeping, at such a late hour, maybe a teenager is up on their phone, or a parent is reading a book or watching a TV show, trying to get one more episode in before sleep.  I’m drawn back to you when you say my name.   

“Are you even listening to me? I’m trying to tell you how I feel and you're really ignoring me? You can’t bring up these issues then act like they don’t exist when I’m finally with you. This is ridiculous.”   

I can hear the pain behind every word. The anger and pity and sadness surrounding us is suffocating. I look at my hands, the road, my feet, drift off into thought again, although I want to respond. You don’t care. You keep talking as I try to do anything but think of you and this dreadful conversation. You tell me you can’t keep doing this, arguing and getting back together, over and over and over again. You say that I’m too much to handle and I can’t keep making you feel bad about wanting to hang out with your friends. I want to speak up and say I don’t do that, but I know you’re right.   

I look down at my frail fingernails, they are flaking away from my incessant ripping. I watch as my skin becomes paper and small pieces of it peel off and fly out the open window into the night. When I look down, I can see my glass bones peek out from underneath the whispering paper as more and more of me becomes dust in the wind.   

“This is too hard on me—on both of us.”  

We take turns and loop back around, taking another winding backroad to my house. Another road with faceless, dull houses that blend into one another from how fast you’re driving. Another road with no light except the face of the moon and the cones of your headlights peaking through the thick brush. The road twists and turns like a serpent and my head spins in circles from the moving of the car. You slam on the brakes on a particularly hard turn and I finally look up at you, if only just for just a moment. Your features are stone and the outline of your face is reflected on the window pane, lit only by the orange lights coming from the console. I see no emotion, no flickering, no movement. Only the curve of your lips as you speak.  

“You can’t keep doing this. I want to be with you, but you’re making it so hard. You guilt me at every turn and I can’t take it anymore.”  

Every word that comes from your mouth burns through me. If you breathe too hard, I fear I may fall over and break into tiny pieces all over the floor of your car, just to be swept away, stepped on, and ignored like all the fast food bags and candy wrappers littered at my feet.   

When we pass my house heading north, your words turn sour and spit at me like venom. Your lips curl around every word, every sentence ending with a punch to my face. I can feel my layers going up in flames and the glass bones heating up under the pressure. They eat away at me slowly, but surely, and I can’t do anything but sit and watch.   

“You’re crazy. You’re depressed. You need help. You know I want to love you. But we can’t do this. Not anymore.”  

Roads stretch out farther and farther and the pain in my head has its own heartbeat. I take deep breaths, rolling down the window even more to drown out the sound of my sniffling and the hurt in your voice as you push me deeper and deeper in the seat with your words. I want to cry, scream, kick and shout at you but I don’t. I hold back in fear of what you’ll do to me. But I can’t take it. My fingers are burning from how hard I’m gripping my legs to my chest. I cover my mouth and breathe deeply but the sobs come violently, shaking what’s left of me to pieces.   

As I crumble in the passenger seat, you reach out and grab my hand. It feels wrong, but I hold on for dear life, wishing so deeply I could get back the pieces of me that have torn off and flown away. Holding your hand feels like a magnet and I can feel myself slowly being rebuilt by the warmth of your fingers. The tears welling in my tired eyes create rainbows of color as the passing streetlights filter by. They ricochet through my thoughts, slicing them in half as I open my mouth to speak. I’m silenced by the turmoil that is my brain.   

I don’t speak, still holding onto your hand, wondering why I’m here. But I’m in pieces and the last of them are holding onto you with everything they have, unwilling to let go despite my pleas. I cry and cry, over the music in the car and the wind rattling in through the window.   

I am rubble. I am simply all that is left of a girl who has been torn down to her bits and pieces, overworked and exhausted and lost. Somehow I stop crying and you take back your hand like it had never held mine at all, though I can still feel the warmth of your skin on mine. I reach out to grab your hand again but it’s already gripping the steering wheel again.   

The windows roll up as the rain comes on. I sit, a husk, in the passenger seat which I have made home in many times. The rain sounds like millions of tiny little tapping feet running along the car and I look back out the window, adjusting my eyes through the shield of raindrops on the glass. I press my hand to it, cold, but your hands had burned like a fire against mine. I turn just a little so I can see your hand on the wheel, wishing I could hold it again. My paper skin dampens from the glass and I pull away as we approach my house. I can feel it all; the anger, guilt, and tension built up between us. Neither of us can look at eachother so I stare at the orange buttons and knobs in your car, *AM, FM, AUX, CD, Volume, Channel, A/C.*   

When I go inside my house, no one looks at me, I don’t even think my parents see me anymore. I return to my room, barely holding together, my skin ghostly thin and pulled tight from the tears staining my cheeks.   

“Goodnight.”
